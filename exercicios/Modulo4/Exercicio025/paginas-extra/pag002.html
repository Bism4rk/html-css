    <p>Listen, Jack, we're gonna pass that motherfucking healthcare whether they like it or NOT!</p>
    <p>Here's what Tucker Carlson had to say on this: "The woke Democrats are at it again! Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Praesentium delectus esse sit at doloribus, mollitia incidunt sapiente! Natus ut aliquam dolor perspiciatis ea mollitia explicabo praesentium dicta odit beatae culpa est reiciendis a eveniet laboriosam non impedit, at illum soluta consequatur maxime adipisci in. Officia odio voluptatem voluptates sequi fuga iure illum earum? Odit ipsam corporis odio similique quia quae, dolorum veniam quaerat voluptates dolor provident soluta animi nobis autem? Borealis!</p>

    <p>And what about former President Trump? Well: "Folks, the bourgeois, they're no good everyone is saying it. All these workers, very handsome workers come up to me and say, Comrade Trump there is a specter haunting Europe, and you know what, they're right. These bourgeois are very nasty people very very rude and very unfair to the workers. They are stealing our surplus value and no one is doing anything about it. The proletariat comes up to me everyday and says, Comrade Trump will you lead the revolution? And I gotta turn to them and say, Look the instruments of capitalism will be used to bring about its destruction believe me you gotta trust me on this one. The means of production, obama never wanted to seize them. Well guess what? I'm seizing them. Landlords? They're done for folks. Everyone told me they said, Comrade Trump you won't be the vanguard of the revolution and they would laugh, the media laughed the democrats laughed, guess whose laughing now?"</p>
